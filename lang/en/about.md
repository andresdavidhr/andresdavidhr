## üß† About me

My name is Andr√©s David, and I would describe myself professionally as a programmer passionate about data, automation, and efficient processes.
Since I started my professional career, I have provided 24/7 support for critical environments, highlighting the development of custom scripts in Linux environments.
I enjoy building robust, reliable solutions with quantifiable business impact.

Since the beginning of my career in the IT sector, I have been deeply committed to optimization and continuous improvement of processes related to data management.
One of my greatest achievements has been significantly reducing data loading incidents. This achievement has not only improved operational efficiency but has also increased the reliability of data used by different departments within the company.

Task automation has been another essential pillar of my work. Through the implementation of various tools and automated scripts, we have managed to significantly streamline daily work.
These improvements have allowed the team to focus on higher value-added activities and have considerably reduced the time dedicated to repetitive and error-prone tasks.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my role has been collaborating with different teams and departments. This collaboration has allowed me to better understand the company's needs and adapt our solutions to effectively meet these needs. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to lead important projects that have had a direct impact on the company's efficiency and productivity.
My approach has always been proactive, constantly seeking new ways to improve existing systems and processes. This mindset has allowed me to stay at the forefront of the latest trends and technologies in the IT sector (as much as possible), ensuring that our data warehouse solutions are robust, scalable, and efficient.

I am proud of the achievements we have reached as a team and am grateful for the learning and growth opportunities I have had throughout these years.

To conclude, I am eager to continue contributing and keep developing professionally in this exciting field.
